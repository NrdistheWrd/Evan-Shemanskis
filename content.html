            <p>As mentioned, my channel is focused on gaming and tech. At first, I was just uploading gameplay videos. However, I eventually recognized that, not only were my gameplay videos admittedly not that great, but also that I needed something to help separate me from everyone else. And then it hit me!</p>

            <p>One year later, in May 2020 and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to change angles and start a new series called Tech in 2. It's exacly what is sounds like: news from the week's tech world in under 2 minutes. My audience, new and old, loved this new approach and is why I'm still making videos for it! This was when I knew I had the skill to continue doing something that I loved.</p>

            <p>Almost 4 years since and thousands of views later, Tech in 2 has been the main series for my channel and my favorite content to create. And almost 5 years, 450 subscribers and 400+ videos later, I still love what I do!</p>
